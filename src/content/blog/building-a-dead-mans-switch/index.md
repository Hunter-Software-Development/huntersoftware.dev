I built the prototype for Dead Man's Switch  over several off-and-on months using a smorgasbord of technologies that I wanted to learn or improve in.  

The project started with a **React** front-end

**Tailwind**

**NestJS**

**GraphQL**

**Monorepo**

**Docker**

**Kubernetes**

**Mongo**

**Helm**

**Okteto**
